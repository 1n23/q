If you have VC 2010 installed and YASM in your path, you should be able to compile
Werkkzeug3 out of the box, albeit with some warnings.

As usual, there were some minor changes made to get it to compile with VS2010.
The player_mobile stuff was just removed from the solution - the mobile stuff was
for PDA targets running Windows CE, and compiled using Embedded VC6. Vile stuff.
Didn't seem worth the hassle, because *nobody* has the right build environment for
this anymore anyway.

A clean compile should be able to play back debris, if you find the right op to
view :).
